#Code of Conduct Devop Group 1

1. The team members must be on time at the meetings and finish b the time as agreed upon, schedule another meeting if necessary.

2. Commit only to what you are going to do and if you commit, do it. If you can't let the people that depend on you know as soon as possible.

3. Share notes and opinion after meetings. Visibility is the key. Shoot and email after a meeting to all who might be interested.

4. Work as a team at the same time. Every team member must be available to work together upon the set time.

5. Prefer small things that you complete to big, long lasting tasks. Be it a github issue, small and done better than big and started.
